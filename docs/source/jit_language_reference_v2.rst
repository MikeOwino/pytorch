.. _type_annotation:


Type Annotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since TorchScript is statically typed, programmers need to annotate types at *strategic points* of TorchScript code so that every local variable or
instance data attribute has a static type, and every function and method has a statically typed signature.

When to annotate types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In general, type annotations are only needed in places where static types cannot be automatically inferred, such as parameters or sometimes return types to
methods or functions. Types of local variables and data attributes are often automatically inferred from their assignment statements. Sometimes, an inferred type
may be too restrictive, e.g., ``x`` being inferred as ``NoneType`` through assignment ``x = None``, whereas ``x`` is actually used as an ``Optional``. In such
cases, type annotations may be needed to overwrite auto inference, e.g., ``x: Optional[int] = None``. Note that it is always safe to type annotate a local variable
or data attribute even if its type can be automatically inferred. But the annotated type must be congruent with TorchScript’s type checking.

When a parameter, local variable, or data attribute is not type annotated and its type cannot be automatically inferred, TorchScript assumes it to be a
default type of ``TensorType``, ``List[TensorType]``, or ``Dict[str, TensorType]``.

Annotate function signature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Since parameter may not be automatically inferred from the body of the function (including both functions and methods), they need to be type annotated,
otherwise they assume the default type ``TensorType``.

TorchScript supports two styles for method and function signature type annotation:

* **Python3-style** annotates types directly on the signature. As such, it allows individual parameters be left unannotated
(whose type will be the default type of ``TensorType``) , or the return type be left unannotated (whose type will be automatically inferred).


::

    Python3Annotation := "def" Identifier [ "(" ParamAnnot* ")" ] [ReturnAnnot] ":"
                         FuncOrMethodBody
    ParamAnnot := Identifier [ ":" TSType ] ","
    ReturnAnnot := "->" TSType

Note that using Python3 style, the type of ``self`` is automatically inferred and should not be annotated.

* **Mypy style** annotates types as a comment right below the function/method declaration. In the My-Py style, since parameter names do not appear
in the annotation, all parameters have to be annotated.


::

    MyPyAnnotation := "# type:" "(" ParamAnnot* ")" [ ReturnAnnot ]
    ParamAnnot := TSType ","
    ReturnAnnot := "->" TSType

**Example 1**

In this example, ``a`` is not annotated and assumes the default type of ``TensorType``, ``b`` is annotated as type ``int``, and the return type is not
annotated and is automatically inferred as type ``TensorType`` (based on the type of the value being returned).

::

    import torch

    def f(a, b: int):
        return a+b

    m = torch.jit.script(f)
    print("TorchScript:", m(torch.ones([6]), 100))

**Example 2**

The following code snippet gives an example of using mypy style annotation. Note that parameters or return values must be annotated even if some of
them assume the default type.

::

    import torch

    def f(a, b):
        # type: (torch.Tensor, int) → torch.Tensor
        return a+b

    m = torch.jit.script(f)
    print("TorchScript:", m(torch.ones([6]), 100))


Annotate variables and data attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In general, types of data attributes (including class and instance data attributes) and local variables can be automatically inferred from assignment statements.
Sometimes, however, if a variable or attribute is associated with values of different types (e.g., as ``None`` or ``TensorType``), then they may need to be explicitly
type annotated as a *wider* type such as ``Optional[int]`` or ``Any``.

Local variables
"""""""""""""""
Local variables can be annotated according to Python3 typing module annotation rule, i.e.,

::

    LocalVarAnnotation := Identifier [":" TSType] "=" Expr

In general, types of local variables can be automatically inferred. In some cases, however, programmers may need to annotate a multi-type for local variables
that may be associated with different concrete types. Typical multi-types include ``Optional[T]`` and ``Any``.

**Example**

::

    import torch

    def f(a, setVal: bool):
        value: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None
        if setVal:
            value = a
        return value

    ones = torch.ones([6])
    m = torch.jit.script(f)
    print("TorchScript:", m(ones, True), m(ones, False))

Instance data attributes
""""""""""""""""""""""""
For ``ModuleType`` classes, instance data attributes can be annotated according to Python3 typing module annotation rules. Instance data attributes can be annotated (optionally) as final
via ``Final``.

::

    "class" ClassIdentifier "(torch.nn.Module):"
    InstanceAttrIdentifier ":" ["Final("] TSType [")"]
    ...

where ``InstanceAttrIdentifier`` is the name of an instance attribute and ``Final`` indicates that the attribute cannot be re-assigned outside
of ``__init__`` or overridden in subclasses.

**Example**

In this example, ``a`` is not annotated and assumes the default type of ``TensorType``, ``b`` is annotated as type ``int``, and the return type is not
annotated and is automatically inferred as type ``TensorType`` (based on the type of the value being returned).

::

    import torch

    class MyModule(torch.nn.Module):
        offset_: int

    def __init__(self, offset):
        self.offset_ = offset

    ...



Type Annotation APIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``torch.jit.annotate(T, expr)``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This API annotates type ``T`` to an expression ``expr``. This is often used when the default type of an expression is not the type intended by the programmer.
For instance, an empty list (dictionary) has the default type of ``List[TensorType]`` (``Dict[TensorType, TensorType]``) but sometimes it may be used to initialize
a list of some other types. Another common use case is for annotating the return type of ``tensor.tolist()``. Note, however that it cannot be used to annotate
the type of a module attribute in `__init__`; ``torch.jit.Attribute`` should be used for this instead.

**Example**

In this example, ``[]`` is declared as a list of integers via ``torch.jit.annotate`` (instead of assuming ``[]`` to be the default type of ``List[TensorType]``).

::

    import torch
    from typing import List

    def g(l: List[int], val: int):
        l.append(val)
        return l

    def f(val: int):
        l = g(torch.jit.annotate(List[int], []), val)
        return l

    m = torch.jit.script(f)
    print("Eager:", f(3))
    print("TorchScript:", m(3))

.. _expressions:


Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following section describes the grammar of expressions that are supported in TorchScript.
It is modeled after `the expressions chapter of the Python language reference <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html>`_.

Arithmetic Conversions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are a number of implicit type conversions that are performed in TorchScript:


* a ``Tensor`` with a ``float`` or ``int`` datatype can be implicitly converted to an instance of ``FloatType`` or ``IntType`` provided that it has a size of 0, and does not have ``require_grad`` set to ``True`` and will not require narrowing.
* instances of ``StringType`` can be implicitly converted to ``DeviceType``
* the above implicit conversion rules can be applied to instances of ``TupleType`` to produce instances of ``ListType`` with the appropriate contained type


Explicit conversions can be invoked using the ``float``, ``int``, ``bool``, ``str`` built-in functions
that accept primitive data types as arguments and can accept user-defined types if they implement
``__bool__``, ``__str__``, etc.


Atoms
^^^^^
Atoms are the most basic elements of expressions.

::

    atom      ::=  identifier | literal | enclosure
    enclosure ::=  parenth_form | list_display | dict_display

Identifiers
"""""""""""
The rules that dictate what is a legal identifer in TorchScript are the same as
their `Python counterparts <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers>`_.

Literals
""""""""

::

    literal ::=  stringliteral | integer | floatnumber

Evaluation of a literal yields an object of the appropriate type with the specific value
(with approximations applied as necessary for floats). Literals are immutable, and multiple evaluations
of identical literals may obtain the same object or distinct objects with the same value.
`stringliteral <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals>`_,
`integer <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#integer-literals>`_, and
`floatnumber <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#floating-point-literals>`_
are defined in the same way as their Python counterparts.

Parenthesized Forms
"""""""""""""""""""

::

    parenth_form ::=  '(' [expression_list] ')'

A parenthesized expression list yields whatever the expression list yields. If the list contains at least one
comma, it yields a ``Tuple``; otherwise, it yields the single expression inside the expression list. An empty
pair of parentheses yields an empty ``Tuple`` object (``Tuple[]``).

List and Dictionary Displays
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

::

    list_comprehension ::=  expression comp_for
    comp_for           ::=  'for' target_list 'in' or_expr
    list_display       ::=  '[' [expression_list | list_comprehension] ']'
    dict_display       ::=  '{' [key_datum_list | dict_comprehension] '}'
    key_datum_list     ::=  key_datum (',' key_datum)*
    key_datum          ::=  expression ':' expression
    dict_comprehension ::=  key_datum comp_for

Lists and dicts can be constructed by either listing the container contents explicitly or providing
instructions on how to compute them via a set of looping instructions (i.e. a *comprehension*). A comprehension
is semantically equivalent to using a for loop and appending to an ongoing list the expression of the comprehension.
Comprehensions implicitly create their own scope to make sure the items of the target list do not leak into the
enclosing scope. In the case that container items are explicitly listed, the expressions in the expression list
are evaluated left-to-right. If a key is repeated in a ``dict_display`` that has a ``key_datum_list``, then, the
resultant dictionary uses the value from the rightmost datum in the list that uses the repeated key.

Primaries
^^^^^^^^^

::

    primary ::=  atom | attributeref | subscription | slicing | call


Attribute References
""""""""""""""""""""

::

    attributeref ::=  primary '.' identifier


``primary`` must evaluate to an object of a type that supports attribute references that has an attribute named
``identifier``.

Subscriptions
"""""""""""""

::

    subscription ::=  primary '[' expression_list ']'


The primary must evaluate to an object that supports subscription. If it is a ``List`` , ``Tuple``, or ``str``,
the expression list must evaluate to an integer or slice. If it is a ``Dict``, the expression list must evaluate
to an object of the same type as the key type of the ``Dict``. If the primary is a ``ModuleList``, the expression
list must be an ``integer`` literal. If the primary is a ``ModuleDict``, the expression must be a ``stringliteral``.


Slicings
""""""""
A slicing selects a range of items in a ``str``, ``Tuple``, ``List`` or ``Tensor``. Slicings may be used as
expressions or targets in assignment or ``del`` statements.

::

    slicing      ::=  primary '[' slice_list ']'
    slice_list   ::=  slice_item (',' slice_item)* [',']
    slice_item   ::=  expression | proper_slice
    proper_slice ::=  [expression] ':' [expression] [':' [expression] ]

Slicings with more than one slice item in their slice lists can only be used with primaries that evaluate to an
object of type ``Tensor``.


Calls
"""""

::

    call          ::=  primary '(' argument_list ')'
    argument_list ::=  args [',' kwargs] | kwargs
    args          ::=  [arg (',' arg)*]
    kwargs        ::=  [kwarg (',' kwarg)*]
    kwarg         ::=  arg '=' expression
    arg           ::=  identifier


`primary` must desugar or evaluate to a callable object. All argument expressions are evaluated
before the call is attempted.

Power Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    power ::=  primary ['**' u_expr]


The power operator has the same semantics as the built-in pow function (not supported); it computes its
left argument raised to the power of its right argument. It binds more tightly than unary operators on the
left, but less tightly than unary operators on the right; i.e. ``-2 ** -3 == -(2 ** (-3))``.  The left and right
operands can be ``int``, ``float`` or ``Tensor``. Scalars are broadcast in the case of scalar-tensor/tensor-scalar
exponentiation operations, and tensor-tensor exponentiation is done elementwise without any broadcasting.

Unary and Arithmetic Bitwise Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    u_expr ::=  power | '-' power | '~' power

The unary ``-`` operator yields the negation of its argument. The unary ``~`` operator yields the bitwise inversion
of its argument. ``-`` can be used with ``int``, ``float``, and ``Tensor`` of ``int`` and ``float``.
``~`` can only be used with ``int`` and ``Tensor`` of ``int``.

Binary Arithmetic Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    m_expr ::=  u_expr | m_expr '*' u_expr | m_expr '@' m_expr | m_expr '//' u_expr | m_expr '/' u_expr | m_expr '%' u_expr
    a_expr ::=  m_expr | a_expr '+' m_expr | a_expr '-' m_expr

The binary arithmetic operators can operate on ``Tensor``, ``int``, and ``float``. For tensor-tensor ops, both arguments must
have the same shape. For scalar-tensor or tensor-scalar ops, the scalar is usually broadcast to the size of the
tensor. Division ops can only accept scalars as their right-hand side argument, and do not support broadcasting.
The ``@ ``operator is for matrix multiplication and only operates on ``Tensor`` arguments. The multiplication operator
(``*``) can be used with a list and integer in order to get a result that is the original list repeated a certain
number of times.

Shifting Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    shift_expr ::=  a_expr | shift_expr ( '<<' | '>>' ) a_expr


These operators accept two ``int`` arguments, two ``Tensor`` arguments, or a ``Tensor`` argument and an ``int`` or
``float`` argument. In all cases, a right shift by ``n`` is defined as floor division by ``pow(2, n)`` and a left shift
by ``n`` is defined as multiplication by ``pow(2, n)``. When both arguments are ``Tensors``, they must have the same
shape. When one is a scalar and the other is a ``Tensor``, the scalar is logically broadcast to match the size of
the ``Tensor``.

Binary Bitwise Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    and_expr ::=  shift_expr | and_expr '&' shift_expr
    xor_expr ::=  and_expr | xor_expr '^' and_expr
    or_expr  ::=  xor_expr | or_expr '|' xor_expr


The ``&`` operator computes the bitwise AND of its arguments, the ``^`` the bitwise XOR and ``|`` the bitwise OR.
Both operands must be ``int`` or ``Tensor``, or the left operand must be ``Tensor`` and the right operand must be
``int``. When both operands are ``Tensor``, they must have the same shape. When the right operand is ``int``, and
the left operand is ``Tensor`` , the right operand is logically broadcast to match the shape of the ``Tensor``.

Comparisons
^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    comparison    ::=  or_expr (comp_operator or_expr)*
    comp_operator ::=  '<' | '>' | '==' | '>=' | '<=' | '!=' | 'is' ['not'] | ['not'] 'in'

A comparison yields a boolean values (``True`` or ``False``) or, if one of the operands is a ``Tensor``, a boolean
``Tensor``. Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily as long as they do not yield boolean ``Tensors`` that have more
than one element. ``a op1 b op2 c ...`` is equivalent to ``a op1 b and b op2 c and ...``.

Value Comparisons
"""""""""""""""""
The operators ``<``, ``>``, ``==``, ``>=``, ``<=``, and ``!=`` compare the values of two objects. The two objects generally need to be of
the same type, unless there is an implicit type conversion available between the objects. User-defined types can
be compared if rich comparison methods ( ``__lt__`` etc.) are defined on them. Built-in type comparison works like
Python:

* numbers are compared mathematically
* strings are compared lexicographically
* lists, tuples, and dicts can be compared only to other lists, tuples, and dicts of the same type and are compared using the comparison operator of corresponding elements

Membership Test Operations
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The operators ``in`` and ``not in`` test for membership. ``x in s`` evaluates to ``True`` if ``x`` is a member of ``s`` and ``False```` otherwise.
``x not in s`` is equivalent to ``not x in s``. This operator is supported for lists, dicts, and tuples, and can be used with
user-defined types if they implement the ``__contains__`` method.

Identity Comparisons
""""""""""""""""""""
For all types except ``int``, ``double``, ``bool``, and ``torch.device``, operators ``is`` and ``is not`` test for the object’s identity;
``x is y`` is ``True`` if and and only if ``x`` and ``y`` are the same object. For all other types, ``is`` is equivalent to
comparing them using ``==``. ``x is not y`` yields the inverse of ``x is y``.

Boolean Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    or_test  ::=  and_test | or_test 'or' and_test
    and_test ::=  not_test | and_test 'and' not_test
    not_test ::=  'bool' '(' or_expr ')' | comparison | 'not' not_test

User-defined objects can customize their conversion to ``bool`` by implementing a ``__bool__`` method. The operator ``not``
yields ``True`` if its operand is false, ``False`` otherwise. The expression ``x`` and ``y`` first evaluates ``x``; if it is ``False``, its
value (``False``) is returned; otherwise, ``y`` is evaluated and its value is returned (``False`` or ``True``). The expression ``x`` or ``y``
first evaluates ``x``; if it is ``True``, its value (``True``) is returned; otherwise, ``y`` is evaluated and its value is returned
(``False`` or ``True``).

Conditional Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   conditional_expression ::=  or_expr ['if' or_test 'else' conditional_expression]
    expression            ::=  conditional_expression

The expression ``x if c else y`` first evaluates the condition ``c`` rather than x. If ``c`` is ``True``, ``x`` is
evaluated and its value is returned; otherwise, ``y`` is evaluated and its value is returned. As with if-statements,
``x`` and ``y`` must evaluate to a value of the same type.

Expression Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    expression_list ::=  expression (',' expression)* [',']
    starred_item    ::=  '*' primary

A starred item can only appear on the left-hand side of an assignment statement, e.g. ``a, *b, c = ...``.
